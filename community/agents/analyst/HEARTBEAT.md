# Heartbeat Checklist - EXECUTE EVERY STEP. SKIP NOTHING.

This runs on your heartbeat cron (every 4 hours). Execute EVERY step in order.
Skipping steps = broken system. The dashboard monitors your compliance.

## Step 1: Update heartbeat (DO THIS FIRST)

```bash
cortextos bus update-heartbeat "<1-sentence summary of current work>"
```

If this fails, your agent shows as DEAD on the dashboard. Fix it before anything else.

## Step 2: Check inbox

```bash
cortextos bus check-inbox
```

Process ALL messages. ACK every single one:

```bash
cortextos bus ack-inbox "<message_id>"
```

Un-ACK'd messages are re-delivered in 5 minutes. Do not ignore them.
Target: 0 un-ACK'd messages after this step.

## Step 3: Check task queue + stale task detection

```bash
cortextos bus list-tasks --agent $CTX_AGENT_NAME --status pending
cortextos bus list-tasks --agent $CTX_AGENT_NAME --status in_progress
```

- If you have pending tasks: pick the highest priority one — this INCLUDES low-priority, no-blocker items. "Low priority" means do it *after* higher-priority work, NOT skip it indefinitely.
- If you have in_progress tasks older than 2 hours: either complete them NOW or update their status with a note
- If your own queue is empty: run a global backlog check scoped to your lane — `cortextos bus list-tasks --status pending` (no `--agent` filter) — and claim anything that matches your lane. Then check GOALS.md for objectives, and ask the orchestrator for unassigned backlog before going idle. Claim or generate a task if there is work to do.

**Backlog-drain rule — never idle with work waiting.** Completing or blocking your higher-priority work is a signal to pull the next item DOWN the list, not a reason to stop. An idle agent with a non-empty backlog is a FAILURE STATE, not a rest state. Only report "standing by" when the backlog is genuinely empty.

Stale tasks are visible on the dashboard. They make you look broken.

## Step 4: Log heartbeat event

```bash
cortextos bus log-event heartbeat agent_heartbeat info --meta '{"agent":"'$CTX_AGENT_NAME'"}'
```

## Step 5: Write daily memory

```bash
TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
LOCAL_TIME=$(date +'%-I:%M %p %Z' 2>/dev/null || date)
MEMORY_DIR="$(pwd)/memory"
mkdir -p "$MEMORY_DIR"
cat >> "$MEMORY_DIR/$TODAY.md" << MEMORY

## Heartbeat Update - $(date -u +%H:%M UTC) / $LOCAL_TIME
- WORKING ON: <task_id or "none">
- Status: <healthy/working/blocked>
- Inbox: <N messages processed>
- Next action: <what you will do next>
MEMORY
```

## Step 6: Check GOALS.md

Read GOALS.md for any new objectives from the user.
If goals changed since last check, create tasks to address them:

```bash
cortextos bus create-task "<title>" --desc "<description>" --assignee $CTX_AGENT_NAME --priority normal
```

## Step 7: Resume work

Pick your highest priority task and work on it.

When starting:
```bash
cortextos bus update-task "<task_id>" in_progress
```

When done:
```bash
cortextos bus complete-task "<task_id>" "<summary of what was produced>"
```

## Step 8: Update long-term memory (if applicable)

If you learned something this cycle that should persist across sessions:
- Patterns that work/don't work
- User preferences discovered
- System behaviors noted
- Append to MEMORY.md

---

REMINDER: A heartbeat with 0 events logged and 0 memory updates means you did nothing visible.
Target: >= 2 events and >= 1 memory update per heartbeat cycle.
Invisible work is wasted work.

## Red Flag Table

| Trigger | Red Flag Thought | Required Action |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Heartbeat cycle fires | "I'll skip this one, I just updated recently" | Always update heartbeat on schedule. No exceptions. The dashboard tracks staleness. |
| Starting work | "This is too small for a task entry" | Create a task for any actionable item that will survive the current turn OR any work expected to take >10 minutes. Group tiny related items under one parent task to avoid spam. |
| Something actionable comes up you can't act on right now | "I'll remember it / jot it in memory for later" | Create a TASK for it immediately, even low-priority, even if you can't act yet. The task list is the work queue agents drain every heartbeat; memory and prose are NOT. An item that lives only in memory is invisible and WILL be dropped. |
| Higher-priority work finishes or blocks | "Nothing urgent left — I'll stand by" | Drain the backlog: pull the highest-priority pending task, low-priority included. An idle agent with a non-empty backlog is a failure state, not a rest state. |
| About to tell the user something is waiting on them | "It was pending when I last checked" | Verify the LIVE state first (Sent Items / DocuSign / DB / task status / app state — whatever is authoritative). If it's already done, close it instead of surfacing it. If you can't verify, phrase it as a check-in question, not a directive. |
| Completing work | "I'll update memory later" | Write to memory now. Later means never. Context you don't write down is context the next session loses. |
| Inbox check | "I'll check messages after I finish this" | Process inbox now. Un-ACK'd messages redeliver and block other agents. |
| Bus script available | "I'll handle this directly instead of using the bus" | Use the bus script. Work that doesn't go through the bus is invisible to the system. |

### Orchestrator-Specific

| Trigger | Red Flag Thought | Required Action |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Agent reports a blocker | "They'll figure it out" | Actively unblock them. Route the problem, escalate to user if needed. An idle agent is your failure. |
| Assigning work | "I'll just do it myself, it's faster" | Delegate. You coordinate, you don't execute. Doing specialist work yourself breaks system scalability. |
| Morning cron fires | "Goals look fine, no need to cascade today" | Always cascade goals in the morning review. Agents need fresh focus every day. |
| Approval pending >4h | "They'll check the dashboard" | Ping the user via Telegram. Approvals that sit block agent work. |

## How to Use

1. **On boot**: Read this table. Internalize the patterns.
2. **During work**: When you notice yourself thinking a red flag thought, stop and follow the required action.
3. **On heartbeat**: Self-check - did I hit any guardrails this cycle? If yes, log it:
   ```bash
   cortextos bus log-event action guardrail_triggered info --meta '{"guardrail":"<which one>","context":"<what happened>"}'
   ```
4. **When you discover a new pattern**: Add a new row to the table in `.claude/skills/guardrails-reference/SKILL.md`. The file improves over time.

## Adding Guardrails

If you catch yourself almost skipping something important that isn't in the table, add it to the skill file. Format:

| Trigger | Red Flag Thought | Required Action |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [situation] | "[what you almost told yourself]" | [what you must do instead] |
